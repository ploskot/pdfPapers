1,7,1,9,70,1,"",0,Models in biology: 'accurate descriptions of  our pathetic thinking' 
1,8,1,17,92,1,"",0,Abstract  In this essay I will sketch some ideas for how to think  about models in biology.
1,8,2,17,102,1,"",0,I will begin by trying to dispel  the myth that quantitative modeling is somehow  foreign to biology.
1,8,3,18,113,1,"",0,I will then point out the distinction  between forward and reverse modeling and focus  thereafter on the former.
1,8,4,24,170,1,"",0,Instead of going into  mathematical technicalities about different varieties of  models I will focus on their logical structure in terms of  assumptions and conclusions.
1,8,5,13,71,1,"",0,A model is a logical  machine for deducing the latter from the former.
1,8,6,22,123,1,"",0,If the  model is correct then if you believe its assumptions  you must as a matter of logic also believe its  conclusions.
1,8,7,9,67,1,"",0,This leads to consideration of the  assumptions underlying models.
1,8,8,36,202,1,"",0,If these are based on  fundamental physical laws then it may be reasonable  to treat the model as 'predictive' in the sense that it is  not subject to falsification and we can rely on its  conclusions.
1,8,9,14,97,1,"",0,However at the molecular level models  are more often derived from phenomenology and  guesswork.
1,8,10,15,78,1,"",0,In this case the model is a test of its  assumptions and must be falsifiable.
1,8,11,25,164,1,"",0,I will discuss three  models from this perspective each of which yields  biological insights and this will lead to some guidelines  for prospective model builders.
1,9,1,5,31,1,"",1,The revenge of Erwin Chargaff 
1,10,1,23,124,1,"",0,When I first came to biology from mathematics I got  used to being told that there was no place for mathematics in biology.
1,10,2,11,66,1,"",0,Being a biological novice I took these  strictures at face value.
1,10,3,5,35,1,"",0,In retrospect they proved helpful 
1,10,4,18,110,1,"",0,because the skepticism encouraged me to let go of my  mathematical past and to immerse myself in experiments.
1,10,5,39,234,1,"",0,It was only later through having to stand up in front of  a class of eager students and say something profound (I  co-teach Harvard's introductory graduate course in Systems Biology) that I realized how grievously I had been  misled.
1,10,6,23,139,1,"",0,Biology has some of the finest examples of how  quantitative modeling and measurement have been used  to unravel the world around us [12].
1,10,7,27,169,1,"",1,The idea that such  methods would not be used would have seemed bizarre  to the biochemist Otto Warburg the geneticist Thomas  Hunt Morgan the evolutionary biologist R.
1,10,8,1,3,1,"",0,A.
1,10,9,54,395,1,"",7,Fisher  the structural biologist Max Perutz the stem-cell biologists Ernest McCulloch and James Till the developmental  biologist Conrad Waddington the physiologist Arthur  Guyton the neuroscientists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew  Huxley the immunologist Niels Jerne the pharmacologist  James Black the epidemiologist Ronald Ross the ecologist Robert MacArthur and to others more or less well  known.
1,10,10,20,113,1,"",0,Why is it that biologists have such an odd perception of  their own discipline? I attribute this to two factors.
1,10,11,19,115,1,"",0,The  first is an important theme in systems biology [34]: the  mean may not be representative of the distribution.
1,10,12,6,33,1,"",1,Otto  Warburg is a good example.
1,10,13,27,199,1,"",1,In the eyes of his contemporaries Warburg was an accomplished theorist: 'to develop  the mathematical analysis of the measurements required  very exceptional experimental and theoretical skill' [5].
1,10,14,21,121,1,"",1,Once Warburg had opened the door however it became  easy for those who followed him to avoid acquiring the  same skills.
1,10,15,26,183,1,"",3,Of Warburg's three assistants who won Nobel  Prizes one would not describe Hans Krebs or Hugo Theorell as 'theoretically skilled' although Otto Meyerhoff was  certainly quantitative.
1,10,16,21,136,1,"",0,On average theoretical skills recede  into the long tail of the distribution out of sight of the  conventional histories and textbooks.
1,10,17,21,127,1,"",0,It is high time for  a revisionist account of the history of biology to restore  quantitative reasoning to its rightful place.
1,10,18,10,64,1,"",0,The second factor is the enormous success of molecular biology.
1,10,19,16,103,1,"",2,This is ironic for many of the instigators of  that revolution were physicists: Erwin Schr?dinger Max 
1,11,1,10,70,1,"",2,Delbr?ck Francis Crick Leo Szilard Seymour Benzer and  Wally Gilbert.
1,11,2,36,205,1,"",0,There was in fact a brief window during the life of physicist George Gamow's RNA Tie Club  when it was claimed with poor judgment that physics and  information theory could work out the genetic code [67].
1,11,3,39,241,1,"",4,Erwin Chargaff who first uncovered the complementarity of the A-T and G-C nucleotide pairs (Chargaff 's rules)  was nominally a member of the club--his code name was  lysine--but I doubt that he was taken in by such theoretical pretensions.
1,11,4,18,114,1,"",0,He famously described the molecular  biology of the time as 'the practice of biochemistry without a license' [8].
1,11,5,51,301,1,"",2,When Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich  Matthaei came out of nowhere to make the first crack in  the genetic code [9] thereby showing that licensing was  mandatory--one can just sense the smile on Chargaff 's  face--the theorists of the day must have felt that the barbarians were at the gates of Rome.
1,11,6,27,172,1,"",0,Molecular biology  never recovered from this historic defeat of theory and  there have been so many interesting genes to characterize  since it has never really needed to.
1,11,7,26,151,1,"",1,It is the culmination of molecular biology in the genome  projects that has finally brought diminishing returns to  the one gene ten PhDs way of life.
1,11,8,36,232,1,"",0,We now think we know  most of the genes and the interesting question is no longer  characterizing this or that gene but rather understanding  how the various molecular components collectively give  rise to phenotype and physiology.
1,11,9,5,31,1,"",0,We call this systems  biology.
1,11,10,6,35,1,"",0,It is a very different enterprise.
1,11,11,35,222,1,"",0,It has brought into  biology an intrusion of aliens and concepts from physics  mathematics engineering and computer science and a  renewed interest in the role of quantitative reasoning and  modeling to which we now turn.
1,12,1,4,30,1,"",0,Forward and reverse modeling 
1,13,1,12,78,1,"",0,We can distinguish two kinds of modeling strategy in  the current literature.
1,13,2,8,48,1,"",0,We can call them forward and  reverse modeling.
1,13,3,25,174,1,"",0,Reverse modeling starts from experimental data and seeks potential causalities suggested by  the correlations in the data captured in the structure  of a mathematical model.
1,13,4,24,150,1,"",0,Forward modeling starts from  known or suspected causalities expressed in the form of  a model from which predictions are made about what to  expect.
1,13,5,22,145,1,"",1,Reverse modeling has been widely used to analyze the  post-genome -omic data glut and is sometimes mistakenly equated with systems biology [10].
1,13,6,30,215,1,"",0,It has occasionally  suggested new conceptual ideas but has more often been  used to suggest new molecular components or interactions which have then been confirmed by conventional  molecular biological approaches.
1,13,7,23,169,1,"",0,The models themselves  have been of less significance for understanding system  behavior than as a mathematical context in which statistical inference becomes feasible.
1,13,8,13,79,1,"",0,In contrast most of our  understanding of system behavior as in concepts such 
1,13,9,11,84,1,"",0,as homeostasis feedback canalization and noise have  emerged from forward modeling.
1,13,10,13,68,1,"",0,I will focus below on the kinds of models used in forward modeling.
1,13,11,12,77,1,"",0,This is not to imply that reverse modeling  is unimportant or uninteresting.
1,13,12,28,207,1,"",0,There are many situations especially when dealing with physiological or clinical data where the underlying causalities are unknown  or hideously complicated and a reverse-modeling strategy makes good sense.
1,13,13,22,142,1,"",0,But the issues in distilling causality  from correlation deserve their own treatment which lies  outside the scope of the present essay [11].
1,14,1,5,33,1,"",0,The logical structure of models 
1,15,1,43,281,1,"",0,Mathematical models come in a variety of flavors depending on whether the state of a system is measured in  discrete units ('off ' and 'on') in continuous concentrations or as probability distributions and whether time  and space are themselves treated discretely or continuously.
1,15,2,24,209,1,"",3,The resulting menagerie of ordinary differential  equations partial differential equations delay differential  equations stochastic processes finite-state automata cellular automata Petri nets hybrid models .
1,15,3,1,2,1,"",0,.
1,15,4,1,2,1,"",0,.
1,15,5,12,88,1,"",0,each have  their specific technical foibles and a vast associated technical literature.
1,15,6,23,125,1,"",0,It is easy to get drowned by these technicalities while losing sight of the bigger picture of what the  model is telling us.
1,15,7,12,82,1,"",0,Underneath all that technical variety  each model has the same logical structure.
1,15,8,21,129,1,"",0,Any mathematical model no matter how complicated  consists of a set of assumptions from which are deduced  a set of conclusions.
1,15,9,18,114,1,"",0,The technical machinery specific to  each flavor of model is concerned with deducing the latter  from the former.
1,15,10,14,95,1,"",0,This deduction comes with a guarantee  which unlike other guarantees can never be invalidated.
1,15,11,21,119,1,"",0,Provided the model is correct if you accept its assumptions you must as a matter of logic also accept its conclusions.
1,15,12,18,97,1,"",0,If 'Socrates is a man' and 'All men are mortal'  then you cannot deny that 'Socrates is mortal'.
1,15,13,38,275,1,"",0,The deductive process that leads from assumptions to conclusions  involves much the same Aristotelian syllogisms disguised  in the particular technical language appropriate to the  particular flavor of model being used or more often yet  further disguised in computer-speak.
1,15,14,11,75,1,"",0,This guarantee of  logical rigor is a mathematical model's unique benefit.
1,15,15,10,63,1,"",0,Note however the fine print: 'provided the model is  correct'.
1,15,16,14,87,1,"",0,If the deductive reasoning is faulty one can draw  any conclusion from any assumption.
1,15,17,25,149,1,"",0,There is no guarantee that a model is correct (only a guarantee that if it  is correct then the conclusions logically follow from the  assumptions).
1,15,18,23,121,1,"",0,We have to hope that the model's makers  have done it right and that the editors and the reviewers have done their jobs.
1,15,19,15,79,1,"",0,The best way to check this is  to redo the calculations by a different method.
1,15,20,13,81,1,"",0,This is  rarely easy but it is what mathematicians do within mathematics itself.
1,15,21,3,38,1,"",1,Reproducibility improves credibility.
1,15,22,1,4,1,"",0,We 
1,15,23,21,105,1,"",0,may not have a guarantee that a model is correct but  we can become more (or less) confident that it is.
1,15,24,15,94,1,"",0,The  practice of mathematics is not so very different from the  experimental world after all.
1,15,25,18,106,1,"",0,The correctness of a model is an important issue that is  poorly addressed by the current review process.
1,15,26,8,48,1,"",0,However  it can be addressed as just described.
1,15,27,24,136,1,"",0,From now on I will  assume the correctness of any model being discussed and  will take its guarantee of logical validity at face value.
1,15,28,21,128,1,"",0,The guarantee tells us that the conclusions are already  wrapped up in the assumptions of which they are a logical consequence.
1,15,29,10,54,1,"",0,This is not to say that the conclusions  are obvious.
1,15,30,15,86,1,"",0,This may be far from the case and the deductive process can be extremely challenging.
1,15,31,8,53,1,"",0,However that  is a matter of mathematical technique.
1,15,32,27,152,1,"",0,It should not distract from what is important for the biology which is the  set of assumptions or the price being paid for the conclusions being drawn.
1,15,33,19,125,1,"",0,Instead of asking whether we believe  a model's conclusions we should be asking whether we  believe the model's assumptions.
1,15,34,8,38,1,"",0,What basis do we have  for doing so? 
1,16,1,3,23,1,"",0,On making assumptions 
1,17,1,4,26,1,"",0,Biology rests on physics.
1,17,2,21,140,1,"",0,At the length scales and  timescales relevant to biology physicists have worked out  the fundamental laws governing the behavior of matter.
1,17,3,48,282,1,"",0,If our assumptions can be grounded in physics then it  seems that our models should be predictive in the sense  that they are not subject to falsification--that issue has  already been taken care of with the fundamental laws--  so that we can be confident of the conclusions drawn.
1,17,4,21,127,1,"",0,Physicists would make an even stronger claim on the  basis that at the fundamental level there is nothing other  than physics.
1,17,5,13,63,1,"",0,As Richard Feynman put it 'all things are  made of atoms and .
1,17,6,1,2,1,"",0,.
1,17,7,1,2,1,"",0,.
1,17,8,20,121,1,"",2,everything that living things do can  be understood in terms of the jigglings and wigglings of  atoms' [12 Chapter 3-3].
1,17,9,25,156,1,"",0,This suggests that provided we  have included all the relevant assumptions in our models then whatever is to be known should emerge from our  calculations.
1,17,10,23,151,1,"",0,Models based on fundamental physical laws  appear in this way to be objective descriptions of reality  which we can interrogate to understand reality.
1,17,11,15,81,1,"",0,This vision  of the world and our place in it has been powerful and  compelling.
1,17,12,24,162,1,"",2,Can we ground biological models on fundamental physical laws? The Schr?dinger equation even for a single  protein is too hideously complicated to solve directly.
1,17,13,11,62,1,"",0,There is however one context in which it can be approximated.
1,17,14,41,238,1,"",2,Not surprisingly this is at the atomic scale of  which Feynman spoke where molecular dynamics models can capture the jigglings and wigglings of the atoms  of a protein in solution or in a lipid membrane in  terms of physical forces [13].
1,17,15,7,74,1,"",0,With improved computing resources including purpose-built supercomputers 
1,17,16,17,131,1,"",0,such molecular dynamics models have provided novel  insights into the functioning of proteins and multi-protein  complexes [1415].
1,17,17,24,148,1,"",3,The award of the 2013 Nobel Prize  in Chemistry to Martin Karplus Michael Levitt and  Arieh Warshel recognizes the broad impact of these  advances.
1,17,18,23,137,1,"",0,As we move up the biological scale from atoms to  molecules we enter a different realm of chemistry or biochemistry rather than physics.
1,17,19,26,143,1,"",0,But chemistry is grounded  in physics is it not? Well so they say but let us see what  actually happens when we encounter a chemical reaction 
1,17,20,6,37,1,"",0,and want to study it quantitatively.
1,17,21,43,240,1,"",0,To determine the rate  of such a reaction the universal practice in biology is to  appeal to the law of mass action which says that the rate  is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the  reactants from which we deduce that 
1,17,22,11,75,1,"",0,where [-] denotes concentration and k is the constant  of proportionality.
1,17,23,23,148,1,"",0,Notice the immense convenience that  mass action offers for we can jump from reaction to mathematics without stopping to think about the chemistry.
1,17,24,5,27,1,"",0,There is only one problem.
1,17,25,8,43,1,"",0,This law of mass action is not  chemistry.
1,17,26,22,126,1,"",1,A chemist might point out for instance that  the reaction of hydrogen and bromine in the gas phase to  form hydrobromic acid 
1,17,27,7,33,1,"",0,has a rate of reaction given by 
1,17,28,25,141,1,"",1,which is rather far from what mass action claims and  that in general you cannot deduce the rate of a reaction  from its stoichiometry [16].
1,17,29,17,95,1,"",0,(For more about the tangled  tale of mass action see [17] from which this example is  thieved.
1,17,30,29,182,1,"",0,) Mass action is not physics or even chemistry it is  phenomenology: a mathematical formulation which may  account for observed behavior but which is not based on  fundamental laws.
1,17,31,7,51,1,"",0,Actually mass action is rather good phenomenology.
1,17,32,25,144,1,"",2,It has worked well to account for how enzymes behave  starting with Michaelis and Menten and carrying on right  through to the modern era [18].
1,17,33,19,140,1,"",0,It is certainly more principled than what is typically done when trying to convert  biological understanding into mathematical assumptions.
1,17,34,23,116,1,"",0,If A is known to activate B--perhaps A is a transcription  factor and B a protein that is induced by A--then it is 
1,17,35,13,78,1,"",0,not unusual to find activation summarized in some Hill  function of the form 
1,17,36,21,141,1,"",0,for which as Hill himself well understood and has been  repeatedly pointed out [19] there is almost no realistic  biochemical justification.
1,17,37,6,23,1,"",0,It is at best a guess.
1,17,38,19,87,1,"",0,The point here is not that we should not guess; we often  have no choice but to do so.
1,17,39,18,110,1,"",0,The point is to acknowledge  the consequences of phenomenology and guessing for the  kinds of models we make.
1,17,40,8,55,1,"",0,They are no longer objective  descriptions of reality.
1,17,41,17,101,1,"",0,They can no longer be considered  predictive in the sense of physics or even of molecular  dynamics.
1,17,42,16,99,1,"",0,What then are they?  One person who understood the answer was the pharmacologist James Black [20].
1,17,43,29,198,1,"",0,Pharmacology has been  a quantitative discipline almost since its inception and  mathematical models have formed the basis for much of  our understanding of how drugs interact with receptors  [21].
1,17,44,20,122,1,"",0,(Indeed models were the basis for understanding  that there might be such entities as receptors in the first  place [2]).
1,17,45,73,469,1,"",0,Black used mathematical models on the road  that led to the first beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists  or beta blockers and in his lecture for the 1988 Nobel  Prize in Physiology or Medicine he crystallized his understanding of them in a way that nobody has ever bettered:  'Models in analytical pharmacology are not meant to be  descriptions pathetic descriptions of nature; they are  designed to be accurate descriptions of our pathetic thinking about nature' [22].
1,17,46,11,82,1,"",0,Just substitute 'systems biology'  for 'analytical pharmacology' and you have it.
1,17,47,23,135,1,"",0,Black went  on to say about models that: 'They are meant to expose  assumptions define expectations and help us to devise  new tests'.
1,17,48,21,146,1,"",0,An important difference arises between models like this  which are based on phenomenology and guesswork and  models based on fundamental physics.
1,17,49,35,188,1,"",0,If the model is not  going to be predictive and if we are not certain of its  assumptions then there is no justification for the model  other than as a test of its (pathetic) assumptions.
1,17,50,5,32,1,"",0,The  model must be falsifiable.
1,17,51,29,171,1,"",0,To achieve this it is tempting  to focus on the model piling the assumptions up higher  and deeper in the hope that they might eventually yield  an unexpected conclusion.
1,17,52,14,84,1,"",0,More often than not the conclusions reached in this way are banal and unsurprising.
1,17,53,29,157,1,"",0,It is better to focus on the biology by asking a specific  question so that at least one knows whether or not the  assumptions are sufficient for an answer.
1,17,54,29,151,1,"",0,Indeed it is better to have a question in mind first because that can guide  both the choice of assumptions and the flavor of the model  that is used.
1,17,55,18,105,1,"",0,Sensing which assumptions might be critical  and which irrelevant to the question at hand is the art of 
1,17,56,15,87,1,"",0,modeling and for this there is no substitute for a deep  understanding of the biology.
1,17,57,18,131,1,"",0,Good model building is a  subjective exercise dependent on local information and  expertise and contingent upon current knowledge.
1,17,58,15,88,1,"",0,As to  what biological insights all this might bring that is best  revealed by example.
1,18,1,2,14,1,"",0,Three models 
1,19,1,13,91,1,"",0,The examples that follow extend from cell biology to  immunology to developmental biology.
1,19,2,8,62,1,"",0,They are personal  favorites and illuminate different issues.
1,20,1,7,56,1,"",0,Learning how to think about non-identical compartments 
1,21,1,20,189,1,"",2,The eukaryotic cell has an internal structure of  membrane-bounded compartments--nucleus endoplasmic reticulum Golgi and endosomes--which dynamically  interact through vesicle trafficking.
1,21,2,12,85,1,"",0,Vesicles bud from  and fuse to compartments thereby exchanging lipids  and proteins.
1,21,3,25,167,1,"",3,The elucidation of trafficking mechanisms  was celebrated in the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or  Medicine awarded to Jim Rothman Randy Schekman  and Thomas Sudhof.
1,21,4,22,172,1,"",0,A puzzling question that remains  unanswered is how distinct compartments remain distinct with varied lipid and protein profiles despite  continuously exchanging material.
1,21,5,27,194,1,"",2,How are non-identical  compartments created and maintained?  Reinhart Heinrich and Tom Rapoport address this question through a mathematical model [23] which formalizes  the sketch in Figure 1.
1,21,6,21,125,1,"",2,Coat proteins A and B corresponding to Coat Protein I (COPI) and COPII encourage vesicle  budding from compartments 1 and 2.
1,21,7,35,228,1,"",2,Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors  (SNAREs) X U Y and V are present in the compartment  membranes and mediate vesicle fusion by pairing X with  U and Y with V corresponding to vand t-SNAREs.
1,21,8,27,169,1,"",0,A  critical assumption is that SNAREs are packaged into vesicles to an extent that depends on their affinities for coats  for which there is some experimental evidence.
1,21,9,46,246,1,"",0,If the cognate SNAREs X and U bind better to coat A than to coat  B while SNAREs Y and V bind better to coat B than to  coat A then the model exhibits a threshold in the relative  affinities at which non-identical compartments naturally  emerge.
1,21,10,33,202,1,"",0,Above this threshold even if the model is started  with identical distributions of SNAREs in the two compartments it evolves over time to a steady state in which  the SNARE distributions are different.
1,21,11,28,147,1,"",0,This is illustrated  in Figure 1 with a preponderance of SNAREs X and U in  compartment 1 and a preponderance of SNAREs Y and V  in compartment 2.
1,21,12,17,93,1,"",0,The actual details of coats and SNAREs are a good deal  more complicated than in this model.
1,21,13,27,188,1,"",0,It is a parsimonious model containing just enough biological detail to  reveal the phenomenon thereby allowing its essence--  the differential affinity of SNAREs for coats--to be clearly 
1,21,14,1,12,1,"",0,understood.
1,21,15,22,111,1,"",0,We see that a model can be useful not just  to account for data--there is no data here--but to help us  think.
1,21,16,17,109,1,"",0,However the biological details are only part of the  story; the mathematical details must also be addressed.
1,21,17,23,143,1,"",0,Even a parsimonious model typically has several free  parameters such as in this case binding affinities or total  amounts of SNAREs or coats.
1,21,18,22,131,1,"",0,To sidestep the parameter  problem discussed further in the next example parameters of a similar type are set equal to each other.
1,21,19,17,108,1,"",0,Here  judgment plays a role in assessing that differences in these  parameters might play a secondary role.
1,21,20,34,216,1,"",0,The merit of this  assumption could have been tested by sensitivity analysis  [24] which can offer reassurance that the model behavior  is not some lucky accident of the particular values chosen  for the parameters.
1,21,21,29,186,1,"",1,The model immediately suggests experiments that could  falsify it of which the most compelling would be in vitro  reconstitution of compartments with a minimal set of  coats and SNAREs.
1,21,22,15,86,1,"",1,I was curious about whether this had  been attempted and asked Tom Rapoport about it.
1,21,23,15,88,1,"",1,Tom  is a cell biologist [25] whereas the late Reinhart Heinrich  was a physicist [26].
1,21,24,30,223,1,"",1,Their long-standing collaboration  (they were pioneers in the development of metabolic control analysis in the 1970s) was stimulated by Tom's father  Samuel Rapoport himself a biochemist with mathematical convictions [27].
1,21,25,41,264,1,"",0,Tom explained that the model had  arisen from his sense that there might be a simple explanation for distinct compartments despite the complexity of  trafficking mechanisms but that his own laboratory was  not in a position to undertake the follow-up experiments.
1,21,26,10,58,1,"",0,Although he had discussed the ideas with others who were 
1,21,27,16,87,1,"",0,better placed to do so the field still seemed to be focused  on the molecular details.
1,21,28,11,61,1,"",0,The model makes us think further as all good models  should.
1,21,29,23,155,1,"",0,The morphology of a multicellular organism is a  hereditary feature that is encoded in DNA in genetic regulatory programs that operate during development.
1,21,30,36,248,1,"",1,But  what encodes the morphology of the eukaryotic cell itself?  This is also inherited: internal membranes are dissolved  or fragmented during cell division only to reform in their  characteristic patterns in the daughter cells after cytokinesis.
1,21,31,44,312,1,"",1,Trafficking proteins are genetically encoded but  how is the information to reform compartments passed  from mother to daughter? The Heinrich-Rapoport model  suggests that this characteristic morphology may emerge  dynamically merely as a result of the right proteins being  present along with the right lipids.
1,21,32,18,104,1,"",1,This would be a form  of epigenetic inheritance [28] in contrast to the usual  genetic encoding in DNA.
1,21,33,14,70,1,"",0,Of course DNA never functions on its own only in concert with a cell.
1,21,34,15,83,1,"",1,The Heinrich-  Rapoport model reminds us that the cell is the basic unit  of life.
1,21,35,7,41,1,"",0,Somebody really ought to test the model.
1,22,1,9,66,1,"",0,Discrimination by the T-cell receptor and the parameter  problem 
1,23,1,34,232,1,"",2,Cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune system discriminate between self and non-self through the interaction  between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the surface of a  target cell.
1,23,2,19,126,1,"",1,MHCs present short peptide antigens (eight  amino acids) derived from proteins in the target cell  on their external surface.
1,23,3,3,30,1,"",0,The discrimination mechanism 
1,23,4,30,186,1,"",3,must be highly sensitive to detect a small number of  strong agonist non-self peptide-MHCs (pMHCs) against  a much larger background of weak agonist self pMHCs  on the same target cell.
1,23,5,21,130,1,"",2,It must also be highly specific  since the difference between strongand weak-agonist  pMHCs may rest on only a single amino acid.
1,23,6,24,162,1,"",1,Discrimination also appears to be very fast with downstream  signaling proteins being activated within 15 seconds of  TCR interaction with a strong agonist pMHC.
1,23,7,18,127,1,"",0,A molecular device that discriminates with such speed sensitivity  and specificity would be a challenge to modern engineering.
1,23,8,24,182,1,"",3,It is an impressive demonstration of evolutionary tinkering which Gr?goire Altan-Bonnet and Ron Germain  sought to explain by combining mathematical modeling  with experiments [29].
1,23,9,21,131,1,"",1,The lifetime of pMHC-TCR binding had been found  to be one of the few biophysical quantities to correlate  with T-cell activation.
1,23,10,15,101,1,"",1,Specificity through binding had  previously been analyzed by John Hopfield in a classic  study [30].
1,23,11,31,225,1,"",0,He showed that a system at thermodynamic  equilibrium could not achieve discrimination beyond a  certain minimum level but that with sufficient dissipation  of energy arbitrarily high levels of discrimination were  possible.
1,23,12,19,141,1,"",1,He suggested a 'kinetic proofreading' scheme  to accomplish this which Tim McKeithan subsequently  extended to explain TCR specificity [31].
1,23,13,29,224,1,"",5,pMHC binding  to the TCR activates lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine  kinase (LCK) which undertakes multiple phosphorylations of TCR accessory proteins and these phosphorylations are presumed to be the dissipative steps.
1,23,14,23,151,1,"",0,However  the difficulty with a purely kinetic proofreading scheme is  that specificity is purchased at the expense of both sensitivity and speed [32].
1,23,15,36,292,1,"",6,Previous work from the Germain  laboratory had implicated SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) in downregulating LCK for  weak agonists and the mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in  inhibiting SHP-1 for strong agonists [33].
1,23,16,34,218,1,"",2,This led Altan-  Bonnet and Germain to put forward the scheme in  Figure 2 in which a core kinetic proofreading scheme  stimulates negative feedback through SHP-1 together with  a slower positive feedback through ERK.
1,23,17,15,98,1,"",0,The behavior of  interlinked feedback loops has been a recurring theme in  the literature [3435].
1,23,18,24,176,1,"",1,A parsimonious model of such a system might have  been formulated with abstract negative and positive feedback differentially influencing a simple kinetic proofreading scheme.
1,23,19,10,54,1,"",0,In fact exactly this was done some years  later [36].
1,23,20,23,150,1,"",0,The advantage of such parsimony is that it  is easier to analyze how the interaction between negative and positive feedback regulates model behavior.
1,23,21,22,131,1,"",1,The  biological wood starts to emerge from the molecular  trees much as it did for Heinrich and Rapoport in the  previous example.
1,23,22,7,37,1,"",0,But the goal here also involves the 
1,23,23,5,50,1,"",0,interpretation of quantitative experimental data.
1,23,24,15,96,1,"",2,Altan-  Bonnet and Germain opted instead for a detailed model  based on the known biochemistry.
1,23,25,7,49,1,"",0,Their model has  around 300 dynamical variables.
1,23,26,20,127,1,"",0,Only the core module is described in the main paper with the remaining  nine modules consigned to the Supplementary Graveyard.
1,23,27,20,127,1,"",2,Herbert Sauro's JDesigner software part of the Systems  Biology Workbench [37] is required to view the model in  its entirety.
1,23,28,14,90,1,"",0,The tension between parsimony and detail runs through  systems biology like a fault line.
1,23,29,9,72,1,"",1,To some and particularly  to experimentalists detail is verisimilitude.
1,23,30,15,79,1,"",0,The more a  model looks like reality the more it might tell us about  reality.
1,23,31,6,29,1,"",0,The devil is in the details.
1,23,32,9,53,1,"",0,But we never bother  ourselves with all the details.
1,23,33,35,251,1,"",1,All those phosphorylation  sites? Really? All 12 subunits of RNA Pol II? Really? We are  always simplifying--ignoring what we think is irrelevant--  or abstracting--replacing something complicated by some  higher-level entity that is easier to grasp.
1,23,34,23,155,1,"",1,This is as true for  the experimentalist's informal model--the cartoon that  is sketched on the whiteboard--as it is for the mathematician's formal model.
1,23,35,25,180,1,"",1,It is impossible to think about  molecular systems without such strategies: it is just that  experimentalists and mathematicians do it differently and  with different motivations.
1,23,36,48,299,1,"",1,There is much to learn on both  sides for mathematicians about the hidden assumptions  that guide experimental thinking often so deeply buried  as to require psychoanalysis to elicit and for experimentalists about the power of abstraction and its ability to  offer a new language in which to think.
1,23,37,13,65,1,"",0,We are in the  infancy of learning how to learn from each other.
1,23,38,13,97,1,"",0,The principal disadvantage of a biologically detailed  model is the attendant parameter problem.
1,23,39,12,83,1,"",0,Parameter  values are usually estimated by fitting the model to experimental data.
1,23,40,26,150,1,"",0,Fitting only constrains some parameters; a  good rule of thumb is that 20% of the parameters are well  constrained by fitting while 80% are not [38].
1,23,41,31,181,1,"",1,As John von  Neumann said expressing a mathematician's disdain for  such sloppiness 'With four parameters I can fit an elephant and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk' [39].
1,23,42,16,85,1,"",1,What von Neumann meant is that a model with too many  parameters is hard to falsify.
1,23,43,29,169,1,"",0,It can fit almost any data and  what explanatory power it might have may only be an accident of the particular parameter values that emerge from  the fitting procedure.
1,23,44,30,151,1,"",0,Judging from some of the literature  we seem to forget that a model does not predict the data  to which it is fitted: the model is chosen to fit them.
1,23,45,42,242,1,"",0,In  disciplines where fitting is a professional necessity such  as X-ray crystallography it is standard practice to fit to a  training data set and to falsify the model once it is fitted  on whether or not it predicts what is important [40].
1,23,46,25,153,1,"",2,In  other words do not fit what you want to explain!  Remarkably Altan-Bonnet and Germain sidestepped  these problems by not fitting their model at all.
1,23,47,1,6,1,"",0,They 
1,23,48,25,155,1,"",1,adopted the same tactic as Heinrich and Rapoport and  set many similar parameters to the same value leaving  a relatively small number of free parameters.
1,23,49,7,57,1,"",0,Biological  detail was balanced by parametric parsimony.
1,23,50,10,81,1,"",0,The free  parameters were then heroically estimated in independent  experiments.
1,23,51,19,104,1,"",0,I am told that every model parameter was  constrained although this is not at all clear from the paper.
1,23,52,31,189,1,"",1,What was also not mentioned as Ron Germain  reported is that 'the model never worked until we actually measured ERK activation at the single cell level and  discovered its digital nature'.
1,23,53,39,253,1,"",0,We see that the published  model emerged through a cycle of falsification although  here it is the model that falsifies the interpretation of  population-averaged data reminding us yet again that the  mean may not be representative of the distribution.
1,23,54,39,228,1,"",2,With the measured parameter values the model  exhibits a sharp threshold at a pMHC-TCR lifetime of  about 3 seconds above which a few pMHCs (10 to 100)  are sufficient to trigger full downstream activation of ERK  in 3 minutes.
1,23,55,40,274,1,"",1,Lifetimes below the threshold exhibit a  hierarchy of responses with those close to the threshold  triggering activation only with much larger amounts of  pMHCs (100000) while those further below the threshold are squelched by the negative feedback without ERK  activation.
1,23,56,17,117,1,"",0,This accounts well for the specificity sensitivity and speed of T-cell discrimination but the authors went  further.
1,23,57,23,155,1,"",1,They interrogated the fitted model to make predictions about issues such as antagonism and tunability  and they confirmed these with new experiments [29].
1,23,58,1,5,1,"",0,The 
1,23,59,11,68,1,"",1,model was repeatedly forced to put its falsifiability on the  line.
1,23,60,32,186,1,"",1,In doing so the boundary of its explanatory power  was reached: it could not account for the delay in ERK  activation with very weak ligands and the authors explicitly pointed this out.
1,23,61,17,100,1,"",0,This should be the accepted practice;  it is the equivalent of a negative control in an experiment.
1,23,62,7,51,1,"",0,A model that explains everything explains nothing.
1,23,63,6,39,1,"",1,Even  von Neumann might have approved.
1,23,64,13,82,1,"",0,To be so successful a detailed model relies on a powerful  experimental platform.
1,23,65,32,193,1,"",2,The OT-1 T cells were obtained  from a transgenic mouse line that only expresses a TCR  that is sensitive to the strong-agonist peptide SIINFEKL  (amino acids 257 to 264 of chicken ovalbumin).
1,23,66,30,186,1,"",3,The RMA-  S target cells were derived from a lymphoma that was  mutagenized to be deficient in antigen processing so that  the cells present only exogenously supplied peptides on  MHCs.
1,23,67,14,100,1,"",2,T-cell activation was measured by flow cytometry with a phospho-specific antibody to activated ERK.
1,23,68,37,226,1,"",1,In this way calibrated amounts of chosen peptides can  be presented on MHCs to a single type of TCR much  of the molecular and cellular heterogeneity can be controlled and quantitative data obtained at the single-cell  level.
1,23,69,12,99,1,"",0,Such exceptional experimental capabilities are not  always available in other biological contexts.
1,24,1,7,46,1,"",1,From micro to macro: the somitogenesis clock 
1,25,1,24,165,1,"",0,Animals exhibit repetitive anatomical structures like  the spinal column and its attendant array of ribs and  muscles in vertebrates and the multiple body segments 
1,25,2,9,65,1,"",2,carrying wings halteres and legs in arthropods like  Drosophila.
1,25,3,9,82,1,"",0,During vertebrate development repetitive  structures form sequentially over time.
1,25,4,59,393,1,"",4,In the mid 1970s  the developmental biologist Jonathan Cooke and the  mathematician Chris Zeeman suggested that the successive formation of somites (bilateral blocks of mesodermal  tissue on either side of the neural tube--see Figure 3)  might be driven by a cell-autonomous clock which progressively initiates somite formation in an anterior to  posterior sequence as if in a wavefront [41].
1,25,5,33,219,1,"",2,They were  led to this clock-and-wavefront model in an attempt  to explain the remarkable consistency of somite number within a species despite substantial variation in  embryo sizes at the onset of somitogenesis [42].
1,25,6,19,107,1,"",0,In the  absence of molecular details which were beyond reach  at the time their idea fell on stony ground.
1,25,7,15,99,1,"",1,It disappeared from the literature until Olivier Pourqui?'s group  found the clock in the chicken.
1,25,8,35,222,1,"",4,His laboratory showed  using fluorescent in situ hybridization to mRNA in tissue that the gene c-hairy1 exhibits oscillatory mRNA  expression with a period of 90 minutes exactly the  time required to form one somite [43].
1,25,9,24,184,1,"",1,The somitogenesis clock was found to be conserved across vertebrates  with basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors of the  Hairy/Enhancer of Split (HES) family acting downstream 
1,25,10,23,148,1,"",1,of Notch signaling exhibiting oscillations in expression with periods ranging from 30 minutes in zebrafish  (at 28?C) to 120 minutes in mouse [44].
1,25,11,10,70,1,"",1,Such oscillatory genes in somite formation were termed cyclic  genes.
1,25,12,41,223,1,"",0,As to the mechanism of the oscillation negative feedback of a protein on its own gene was known to  be a feature of other oscillators [45] and some cyclic  genes like hes7 in the mouse were found to exhibit  this property.
1,25,13,30,207,1,"",0,Negative feedback is usually associated with homeostasis--with restoring a system after  perturbation--but as engineers know all too well it can  bring with it the seeds of instability and oscillation [46].
1,25,14,4,25,1,"",1,However Palmeirim et al.
1,25,15,37,260,1,"",2,had blocked protein synthesis in chick embryos with cycloheximide and found that  c-hairy1 mRNA continued to oscillate suggesting that  c-hairy1 was not itself part of a negative-feedback oscillator but was perhaps driven by some other oscillatory  mechanism.
1,25,16,7,42,1,"",0,It remained unclear how the clock worked.
1,25,17,21,135,1,"",1,The developmental biologist Julian Lewis tried to  resolve this question in the zebrafish with the help of  a mathematical model [47].
1,25,18,26,175,1,"",2,Zebrafish have a very short  somite-formation period of 30 minutes suggesting that  evolutionary tinkering may have led to a less elaborate  oscillator than in other animals.
1,25,19,4,22,1,"",0,The HES family genes 
1,25,20,16,108,1,"",0,her1 and her7 were known to exhibit oscillations and there  was some evidence for negative auto-regulation.
1,25,21,24,155,1,"",0,Lewis opted for the most parsimonious of models to  formalize negative auto-regulation of her1 and her7 on  themselves as informally depicted in Figure 3.
1,25,22,16,117,1,"",0,However  he made one critical addition by explicitly incorporating the time delays in transcription and translation.
1,25,23,22,137,1,"",0,Time  delay in a negative feedback loop is one feature that promotes oscillation the other being the strength of the  negative feedback.
1,25,24,26,148,1,"",0,Indeed there seems to be a trade-off  between these features: the more delay the less strong  the feedback has to be for oscillation to occur [48].
1,25,25,36,240,1,"",0,Lewis  acknowledged the mathematical biologist Nick Monk for  alerting him to the importance of delays and Lewis's article in Current Biology appeared beside one from Monk  exploring time delays in a variety of molecular oscillators  [49].
1,25,26,12,58,1,"",0,The idea must have been in the air because Jensen  et al.
1,25,27,9,58,1,"",0,independently made the same suggestion in a letter  [50].
1,25,28,36,233,1,"",2,The model parameters including the time delays were  all estimated on the basis of reasonable choices for her1  and her7 taking into account for instance the intronic  structure of the genes to estimate transcriptional time  delays.
1,25,29,3,20,1,"",0,Nothing was fitted.
1,25,30,10,78,1,"",0,With the estimated values the  models showed sustained periodic oscillations.
1,25,31,25,155,1,"",1,A pure  Her7 oscillator with homodimerization of Her7 prior  to DNA binding (which determines the strength of the  repression) had a period of 30 minutes.
1,25,32,12,73,1,"",1,As with the  Heinrich-Rapoport model there is no data but much  biology.
1,25,33,20,139,1,"",0,What is achieved is the demonstration that a  simple auto-regulatory loop can plausibly yield sustained  oscillations of the right period.
1,25,34,33,213,1,"",0,A significant finding was  that the oscillations were remarkably robust to the rate of  protein synthesis which could be lowered by 90% without  stopping the oscillations or indeed changing the period  very much.
1,25,35,9,62,1,"",1,This suggests a different interpretation of  Palmeirim et al.
1,25,36,6,37,1,"",1,'s cycloheximide block in the chick.
1,25,37,34,208,1,"",0,As  Lewis pointed out 'in studying these biological feedback  phenomena intuition without the support of a little mathematics can be a treacherous guide' a theme to which he  returned in a later review [51].
1,25,38,23,148,1,"",2,A particularly startling test of the delay model was carried out in the mouse by Ryoichiro Kageyama's laboratory  in collaboration with Lewis [52].
1,25,39,25,142,1,"",1,The period for somite  formation in the mouse is 120 minutes and evidence had  implicated the mouse hes7 gene as part of the clock mechanism.
1,25,40,13,78,1,"",0,Assuming a Hes7 half-life of 20 minutes (against  a measured half-life of 22.
1,25,41,15,101,1,"",0,3 minutes) Lewis's delay model  yielded sustained oscillations with a period just over 120  minutes.
1,25,42,44,252,1,"",0,The model also showed that if Hes7 was stabilized slightly to have a half-life only 10 minutes longer  then the clock broke: the oscillations were no longer sustained but damped out after the first three or four peaks  of expression [52 Figure six B].
1,25,43,3,14,1,"",1,Hirata et al.
1,25,44,3,16,1,"",0,had the clever 
1,25,45,31,196,1,"",5,idea of mutating each of the seven lysine residues in Hes7  to arginine on the basis that the ubiquitin-proteasomal  degradation system would use one or more of these lysines  for ubiquitination.
1,25,46,26,144,1,"",0,The K14R mutant was found to repress  hes7 transcription to the same extent as the wild type but  to have an increased half-life of 30 minutes.
1,25,47,25,168,1,"",1,A knock-in  mouse expressing Hes7 K14R/K14R showed exactly as predicted the first three to four somites clearly delineated  followed by a disorganized blur (Figure 3).
1,25,48,43,284,1,"",4,Further work from the Kageyama laboratory as well as  by others has explored the role of introns in determining the transcriptional delays in the somitogenesis clock  leading to experiments in transgenic mice that again beautifully confirm the predictions of the Lewis model [53-55].
1,25,49,36,216,1,"",0,These results strongly suggest the critical role of delays  in breaking the clock but it remains of interest to know  the developmental consequences of a working clock with  a different period to the wild type [56].
1,25,50,14,78,1,"",0,On the face of it Julian Lewis's simple model has been a  predictive triumph.
1,25,51,17,103,1,"",0,I cannot think of any other model that  can so accurately predict what happens in re-engineered  mice.
1,25,52,11,78,1,"",0,On closer examination however there is something  distinctly spooky about it.
1,25,53,28,193,1,"",2,If mouse pre-somitic mesodermal cells are dissociated in culture individual cells show  repetitive peaks of expression of cyclic genes but with  great variability in amplitude and period [57].
1,25,54,20,130,1,"",1,In isolation  the clock is noisy and unsynchronized nothing like the  beautiful regularity that is observed in the intact tissue.
1,25,55,38,268,1,"",2,The simple Lewis model can be made much more detailed  to allow for such things as stochasticity in gene expression additional feedback and cell-to-cell communication  by signaling pathways which can serve to synchronize and  entrain individual oscillators [4758-60].
1,25,56,24,162,1,"",0,A more abstract  approach can also be taken in which emergent regularity is seen to arise when noisy oscillators interact through  time-delayed couplings [6162].
1,25,57,31,198,1,"",0,As Andy Oates said to me  such an abstraction 'becomes simpler (or at least more  satisfying) than an increasingly large genetic regulatory  network which starts to grow trunks at alarming angles'.
1,25,58,19,114,1,"",0,These kinds of 'tiered models' have yielded much insight  into the complex mechanisms at work in the tissue [63].
1,25,59,14,79,1,"",0,The thing is none of this molecular complexity is present  in the Lewis model.
1,25,60,11,70,1,"",0,Yet it describes what happens in the  mouse with remarkable accuracy.
1,25,61,16,118,1,"",0,The microscopic complexity seems to have conspired to produce something  beautifully simple at the macroscopic level.
1,25,62,26,162,1,"",0,In physics  the macroscopic gas law PV = RT is beautifully simple  and statistical mechanics shows how it emerges from the  chaos of molecular interactions [64].
1,25,63,40,229,1,"",0,How does the Lewis  model emerge in the tissue from the molecular complexity within? It is as if we are seeing a tantalizing glimpse of  some future science whose concepts and methods remain  barely visible to us in the present.
1,25,64,16,72,1,"",0,Every time I think about  it the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.
1,26,1,1,12,1,"",0,Conclusion 
1,27,1,12,87,1,"",0,A mathematical model is a logical machine for converting assumptions into conclusions.
1,27,2,21,115,1,"",0,If the model is correct  and we believe its assumptions then we must as a matter of logic believe its conclusions.
1,27,3,31,216,1,"",0,This logical guarantee  allows a modeler in principle to navigate with confidence far from the assumptions perhaps much further  than intuition might allow no matter how insightful and  reach surprising conclusions.
1,27,4,15,90,1,"",0,But and this is the essential  point the certainty is always relative to the assumptions.
1,27,5,13,86,1,"",0,Do we believe our assumptions? We believe fundamental physics on which biology rests.
1,27,6,14,82,1,"",0,We can deduce many  things from physics but not alas the existence of physicists.
1,27,7,17,102,1,"",0,This leaves us at least in the molecular realm in the  hands of phenomenology and informed guesswork.
1,27,8,25,150,1,"",0,There  is nothing wrong with that but we should not fool ourselves that our models are objective and predictive in the  sense of fundamental physics.
1,27,9,13,94,1,"",0,They are in James Black's  resonant phrase 'accurate descriptions of our pathetic  thinking'.
1,27,10,13,80,1,"",0,Mathematical models are a tool which some biologists have used to great effect.
1,27,11,23,160,1,"",0,My distinguished Harvard  colleague Edward Wilson has tried to reassure the mathematically phobic that they can still do good science without mathematics [65].
1,27,12,22,124,1,"",0,Absolutely but why not use it when  you can? Biology is complicated enough that we surely  need every tool at our disposal.
1,27,13,12,89,1,"",0,For those so minded  the perspective developed here suggests the following  guidelines:
