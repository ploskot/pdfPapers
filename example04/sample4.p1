Limits on fundamental limits to computation 
An indispensable part of our personal and working lives, computing has also become essential to industries and governments.
Steady improvements in computer hardware have been supported by periodic doubling of transistor densities in integrated circuits over the past fifty years.
Such Moore scaling now requires ever-increasing efforts, stimulating research in alternative hardware and stirring controversy.
To help evaluate emerging technologies and increase our understanding of integrated-circuit scaling, here I review fundamental limits to computation in the areas of manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and algorithms.
To outline what is achievable in principle and in practice, I recapitulate how some limits were circumvented, and compare loose and tight limits.
Engineering difficulties encountered by emerging technologies may indicate yet unknown limits.
