# help file for texttoinfo command

texttoinfo - a shell script to extract unique words and phrases and their
             frequency of occurrence

General usage:
>> texttoinfo COMMAND [OPTIONS] inputfile

To get the version number and quit:
>> texttoinfo -version

To show this help and quit:
>> texttoinfo -help

To suppress all messages except the generated output:
>> texttoinfo -nomsg COMMAND [OPTIONS] inputfile

To generate bag of words (bow) for inputfile to standard output, so the
output can be stored to a file or processed further:
>> texttoinfo -bow [OPTIONS] inputfile

where OPTIONS:

 -ef {filename} exclude stop words in given file
 -es {string}   exclude space separated words in given string
 -ep {pat}      removes words matching the pattern {pat}
 -w {nubmber}   exclude words shorter than {number} of characters
 -{number}      truncate the output to {number} of lines
 -gt|-eq|lt|-ge|-le {number}  keep only words with given occurrences   
 -so            sort output by number of occurrences
 -sa            sort output alphanumerically
 -sar	       sort output alphanumerically in reverse order
 -sl	       sort by length of strings
 -slr	       sort by length of strings in reverse order
 -o array|clean|freq (default)|rfreq  format output

To get a given number of words before and after and including the given
pattern from inputifle displayed to standard output, so the output can be
stored to a file or further processed:
>> texttoinfo -nwords -p "pattern" [OPTIONS] inputfile
>> texttoinfo -nwords -p "{pattern" [OPTIONS] inputfile
>> texttoinfo -nwords -p "pattern}" [OPTIONS] inputfile
>> texttoinfo -nwords -p "{pattern}" [OPTIONS] inputfile

where "{pattern" matches left word boundary of pattern
      "pattern}" matches right word boundary of pattern

The output is the number of terms before and including the pattern, and the
number of terms after and including the patter, and the complete phrase
containing the pattern in the middle.

and OPTIONS:

 -ef {filename}  exclude stop words given in given file
 -es {string}    exclude space separated words in given string
 -ep {pat}       removes words matching the pattern {pat}
 -w {nubmber}    exclude words shorter than {number} of characters
 -n {+n}         select words from pattern to +n words ahead
 -n {-n}         select words from -n words before to pattern
 -n {-n},{+n}    combine the two selections above
 -n ,{+n}        from beginning of line to +n words ahead of pattern
 -n {-n},        from -n words behind pattern to end of line

To calculate the distance between two word strings:
>> texttoinfo -strdist [-nomsg] [-{number}] {"string1"} {"string2"}

To calculate the distances between one word and the list of other words:
>> texttoinfo -strdist [-nomsg] [-{number}] [-noeq] [-o12|-o1|-o2] \
>>            {"strings"} {"string21"} ... {"string2n"}

The {number} in these commands restrict the output to matches having more
characters than this value. The -noeq option suppresses comparison of equal
strings. The -o option formats the output.
